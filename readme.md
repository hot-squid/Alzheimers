The aim of the study was to determine which individuals are at risk of developing 
a Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) within 3-5 years using only demographic variables 
and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. In other words, data that is accessible and 
doesn't require brain scans or invasive procedures.

There are two files 1) Analysis.ipynb which is a Jupyter Notebook file that 
includes all the code and markdowns and 2) The Data file.
